"I served as the ICT Secretary of the Prothom Alo
 Bandhushava-DIU Club in 2021. In this role,
 I provided technology skill enhancement ideas 
for club members, designed banners, posters, books, 
and leaflets, and took on the primary responsibilities
 of managing and organizing events. I organized several 
events, including a ramp walk, a cake shop festival, 
and a junket festival. During the junket festival,
 I also had the opportunity to host the show."
