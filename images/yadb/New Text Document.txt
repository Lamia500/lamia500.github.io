"Youth Alliance Developing Bangladesh (YADB) is a social youth organization. 
I served as the President of YADB Gazipur for the 2020-2021 term and later
 became the Assistant General Secretary of YADB's national team in 2022. 
In my role with YADB Gazipur, I led a team of over 100 members, guiding
 and managing them to work towards national development. Together, 
we assisted thousands of people by providing food, clothing, shelter, 
medicine, and free education. Additionally, I organized a
 'Free Education Campaign,' where I taught web design, 
basic computer skills, and 3D animation and graphic design 
through online sessions."
